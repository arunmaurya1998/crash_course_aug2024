    <h1>Chemistry Assignment</h1>
    <p><def>Chemistry</def> is the branch of science that deals with properties composition and behavior of matter. It is fascinating field that explores the building block of the universe.</p>
    <h2>Chemical Elements</h2>
    <p>The<cite> Periodic table is a tabular arrangement of chemical elements. Each element is represnted by its chemical symbol such as Fe for iron, H for hydrogen and O for oxygen.Elements are classified into groups and periods based on thair properties.</cite></p>
    <h3>Chemical Equations</h3>
    <p>Chemical reaction are represented using <cite>chemical equation.</cite>Here's an example of a chemical reaction.</p>
    <p>2H<sub>2</sub> + O<sub>2</sub> &rarr; 2H<sub>2</sub>O</p>
    <p>This eqation represented the reaction between hydrogen gas (H<sub>2</sub>) and oxygen gas (O<sub>2</sub>) to form water (H<sub>2</sub>O)</p>
    <h4>Important Concept</h4>
    <p>Stoichiometry is the calculation of reactant and product in chemical reaction. It involves blancing chemical equation to ensure mass and change are conserved <sub> subscript </sub>indicate the number of atoms of each element in a module. While <sup> superscript </sup>represent charge or the number of atoms in an iron.</p>
    <h5>Chemistry plays a crucial role in understanding the world around us. From the composition of the air we breathe to the reactions that power our bodies, chemistry influences every aspect of our lives.</h5>
